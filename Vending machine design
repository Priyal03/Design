### You need to write code to implement a Vending machine that has a bunch of products like chocolates, candy, cold-drink and 
accept some coins like Nickle, Dime, Quarter, Cent, etc. Make sure you insert a coin, get a product back and get your chance 
back. Also, think about the Unit tests. ###

-------------->
vending machine has products; quantity; prices.
we can simply give a cahsless wallet payment or else keep track of each coin Accounts and delete from there as well.
account will depend on prices.

now when user put in money we will keep it aside in tray only. then we calculate whether we will be able to make change and deliver product.
found two sub problems.
    makechange problem()
    productexists()
at last we will calculate and update the accounts table from makechange() and usermoney().
then we will change the products table as well to keep it up to date for next transaction.
